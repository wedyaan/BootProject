  Project Title:
Green Life

2- The description:
Greener Life refers to a concept and lifestyle focused on promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly practices to create a healthier planet. It encompasses various aspects of daily life, including personal choices, consumption habits, and environmental awareness.
The Greener Life movement aims to raise awareness, inspire positive change, and encourage individuals, communities, and organizations to take responsibility for their impact on the environment and work towards a more sustainable and greener world.
Therefore, we will build a website that contains several functions that allow the user to search for environmentally friendly products
The amount of carbon produced by the car is calculated according to the distance traveled by the person
We will display stores that are interested in selling products, and we will build a page to inform the community about the existence of an event concerned with the environment.
